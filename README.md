# Hand_recog_mouse_pointer
This is a simple python project about how we can control our mouse pointer with our hand signals. 

In this project we are using
- Mediapipe
- OpenCV
- PyautoGUI

Basically, when we move our pointer/index finger, the mouse cursor will follow it and when the index and the thumb comes closer, it performs a click.
